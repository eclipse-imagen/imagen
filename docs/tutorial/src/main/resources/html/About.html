<h3>About this Book</h3>

<p>
This tutorial book was written to interactively display
technical information, demos, and code to help the user learn more about
Java Advanced Imaging.  The book-like format allows turning of pages,
selection of pages via an index, and display of demos with associated
source code via tabs.
Technical information, interactive demos, and source code are
readily accessible.  Source code is also available for the display
widgets used in the tutorial.  This code can be found in the distribution's
src directory.
</p>

<p>
To access the index, click on the left page tab labeled "Index."
Technical discussions are obtained by clicking the right page tab labeled
"Text."  Selecting an item from the index will load the appropriate page.
Use the arrows next to the page numbers at the bottom to move
back and forth a single page.  Technical discussions are typically partitioned
into three sections:
<pre>
<strong>  Demo -</strong> gives instructions about how to use the demo
            located on the right page.
<strong>   JAI -</strong> gives technical descriptions of Java Advanced
            Imaging features being demonstrated.
<strong>Theory -</strong> gives brief theoretical descriptions of
            demonstrated topics.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The right page of the book contains interactive demos.  Toggle
between running the demo and viewing source code by clicking on
the "Demo" or "Code" tabs, respectively.  The top
page label will show the currently selected option.  The source
code shown is the actual source code used for the current
demo.  For example, the demo on the right page contains a
magnifier window which can be moved by clicking and dragging
the mouse in the image window.  The button located in the lower
right hand corner of the page near the page number allows moving
to the next page.  The book can be resized and for pages larger
than the book, scrollbars are available for scrolling.
