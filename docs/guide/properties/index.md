> --------------------------------------
>
> In addition to the pixel data, images occasionally have many other
> kinds of data associated with them. These data, known as *properties*,
> is a simple database of arbitrary data attached to the images. Each
> property is simply an Object with a unique, case-insensitive name.
>
> The properties are arbitrary and depend on the intended application.
> JAI provides methods that enable effective use of properties in the
> context of an image processing application but, in most cases, leaves
> the specification of the property objects themselves to the developer.
>
> Some examples of properties are:
>
> -   Descriptions of exotic shapes, such as hexagonal grids
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   Mapping from digital pixel values to photometric values
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   A defined region of interest (ROI) in the source image
>
> Every node in an image chain may be queried for its properties. The
> value of a property at a particular node may be derived by one of the
> following mechanisms:
>
> -   It may be *copied* from the node\'s sources. This is the default
>     behavior if no other behavior is specified.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   It may be *produced* by the node from non-property information
>     available in the node.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   It may be *synthesized* by the node from a rendering.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   It may be *inherited* or produced computationally from the
>     properties of the node\'s sources.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   It may be *set explicitly* by the `setProperty` method in one of
>     the appropriate classes: `Planarimage`, `RenderedOp`, or
>     `RenderableOp`. Properties of a node may not be set once the node
>     has been rendered.
>
> When the value of a property is requested from a node in a rendered
> chain, i.e., a `RenderedOp` node, it will be derived from the first of
> the following for which it is defined:
>
> The same order of precedence applies in the case of renderable chains,
> i.e., RenderableOp nodes, with the exception of item 4, viz.,
> properties created within the contextual rendering of the RenderableOp
> are not propagated back to the RenderableOp node itself.
>
> There are a couple of important items to note at this point. First,
> when a node is created with another node or nodes as its source(s), it
> might invoke methods on the source node that force the source node to
> be rendered. Consequently properties should be set on a node before it
> is used as the source of other operations. Second, the rendering of a
> node does *not* inherit the properties of the node itself nor are
> properties set on the rendering of the node propagated back to the
> node. Image properties are controlled and generated by the
> `PropertySource` and `PropertyGenerator` interfaces.

> ### 11.1.1 ![](shared/space.gif)The PropertySource Interface
>
> The `PropertySource` interface contains methods from the
> `RenderedImage` and `RenderableImage` interfaces that identify and
> read properties. `PlanarImage`, `RenderableOp`, and `RenderedOp` all
> implement `PropertySource`.
>
> The interface consists of the `getProperty` and `getPropertyNames`
> methods familiar from the `RenderedImage` and `RenderableImage`
> interfaces.
>
> `PropertySource` is implemented by `ImageJAI`. Since all
> RenderedImages used within JAI are descendents of `PlanarImage` which
> implements `ImageJAI`, all images may be assumed to implement
> `PropertySource`.

> ### 11.1.2 ![](shared/space.gif)The PropertyGenerator Interface
>
> The `PropertyGenerator` interface allows you to affect the property
> inheritance computation of an operation. A `PropertyGenerator` simply
> implements two methods:
>
> -   The `getPropertyNames` method returns a list of the names of all
>     available properties.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> -   The `getProperty` method returns the value of the property, given
>     the property name and a `RenderedOp`.
>
> New `PropertyGenerators` may be added to the `OperationRegistry` to be
> applied at a particular operation node. The `OperationRegistry` also
> allows an existing property on a node to be suppressed if it is no
> longer useful. See [Chapter 14, \"Extending the
> API](Extension.doc.html#47285),\" for more information on the
> `OperationRegistry`.

> ----------------------------------------------

> synthetic properties are image width (`image_width`), image height
> (`image_height`), minimum *x* coordinate (`image_min_x_coord`), and
> minimum *y* coordinate (`image_min_y_coord`). All of these properties
> have a value of class `java.lang.Integer`. These properties are fixed
> and any attempt to set them will result in an error.

> 11.3 ![](shared/space.gif)Regions of Interest
> ---------------------------------------------
>
> The specification of a region of interest (ROI) is a common property
> that is supported by all of the standard operators. The ROI is simply
> a description of some portion of an image. This description is
> propogated, along with the image, through the rendering chain. The ROI
> is transformed appropriately (inherited) for all geometric and area
> operators. For all other types of operations it is simply copied. The
> ROI has no bearing on the processing of image pixels, although in its
> rendered form it can be used as input to histogram operations. For
> more information, see [Section 6.2, \"Region of Interest
> Control](Image-manipulation.doc.html#51458).\"
>
> The ROI may be used as an argument to the `TiledImage.set` and
> `TiledImage.setData` methods so as to copy a selected area of a source
> or `Raster` into an existing `TiledImage` (see [Section 4.2.2, \"Tiled
> Image](Acquisition.doc.html#52363)\"`)`. The ROI may also be used as
> an argument to many compositing (see [Section 7.11.2, \"Image
> Compositing](Image-enhance.doc.html#61005)\") and statistical
> operators (see [Chapter 9, \"Image
> Analysis](Analysis.doc.html#55366)\").

> 11.4 ![](shared/space.gif)Complex Data
> --------------------------------------
>
> The COMPLEX property has value of class `java.lang.Boolean` and
> indicates whether the pixel values of an image represent complex-value
> data. (A complex-valued image wherein each pixel has N complex
> elements contains 2N bands with the real and imaginary components of
> the *i*th complex element being stored in bands 2i and 2i + 1,
> respectively.) This property may be *produced* by a given node either
> with a fixed value or with a value dependent on the parameters of the
> node. See [Section 7.9, \"Frequency Domain
> Processing](Image-enhance.doc.html#59829).\"
