> want to use Java Advanced Imaging for real projects. To best
> understand this document and the examples, you need a solid background
> in the Java programming language and some experience with imaging. In
> addition, you will need a working knowledge of other Java Extension
> APIs, depending on your intended application:

>
> This version of *Programming in Java Advanced Imaging* is based on
> release 1.0.1 of the Java Advanced Imaging API. Please do not rely on
> this document or the Java Advanced Imaging software for
> production-quality or mission-critical applications. If any
> discrepancies between this book and the javadocs are noted, always
> consider the javadocs to be the most accurate, since they are
> generated directly from the JAI files and are always the most up to
> date.

> About This Book
> ---------------
>
> **[Chapter 1, \"Introduction to Java Advanced
> Imaging](Introduction.doc.html#47285),\"** gives an overview of the
> Java Advanced Imaging API, how it evolved from the original Java
> Advanced Windowing Toolkit (AWT), some of its features, and introduces
> the imaging operations.
>
> **[Chapter 2, \"Java AWT Imaging](J2D-concepts.doc.html#47285),\"**
> reviews the imaging portions of the Java AWT and examines the imaging
> features of the Java 2D API.
>
> **[Chapter 3, \"Programming in Java Advanced
> Imaging](Programming-environ.doc.html#47285),\"** describes how to get
> started programming with the Java Advanced Imaging API.
>
> **[Chapter 4, \"Image Acquisition and
> Display](Acquisition.doc.html#81550),\"** describes the Java Advanced
> Imaging API image data types and the API constructors and methods for
> image acquisition and display.
>
> **[Chapter 5, \"Color Space](Color.doc.html#47285),\"** describes the
> JAI color space, transparency, and the color conversion operators.
>
> **[Chapter 6, \"Image
> Manipulation](Image-manipulation.doc.html#47285),\"** describes the
> basics of manipulating images to prepare them for processing and
> display.
>
> **[Chapter 7, \"Image Enhancement](Image-enhance.doc.html#47285),\"**
> describes the basics of improving the visual appearance of images
> through enhancement techniques.
>
> **[Chapter 8, \"Geometric Image
> Manipulation](Geom-image-manip.doc.html#51140),\"** describes the
> basics of Java Advanced Imaging\'s geometric image manipulation
> functions.
>
> **[Chapter 9, \"Image Analysis](Analysis.doc.html#55366),\"**
> describes the Java Advanced Imaging API image analysis operators.
>
> **[Chapter 10, \"Graphics Rendering](Graphics.doc.html#51143),\"**
> describes the Java Advanced Imaging presentation of shapes and text.
>
> **[Chapter 11, \"Image Properties](Properties.doc.html#47285),\"**
> describes the tools that allow a programmer to add a simple database
> of arbitrary data that can be attached to images.
>
> **[Chapter 12, \"Client-Server
> Imaging](Client-server.doc.html#47285),\"** describes Java Advanced
> Imaging\'s client-server imaging system.
>
> **[Chapter 13, \"Writing Image Files](Encode.doc.html#47285),\"**
> describes Java Advanced Imaging\'s codec system for encoding image
> data files.
>
> **[Chapter 14, \"Extending the API](Extension.doc.html#47285),\"**
> describes how the Java Advanced Imaging API is extended.
>
> **[Appendix A, \"Program Examples](Examples.doc.html#72446),\"**
> contains fully-operational Java Advanced Imaging program examples.
>
> **[Appendix B, \"Java Advanced Imaging API
> Summary](API-summary.doc.html#72446),\"** summarizes the imaging
> interfaces, and classes, including the `java.awt`, `java.awt.Image`,
> and `javax.media.jai` classes.
>
> The **[Glossary](Glossary.doc.html#47771)** contains descriptions of
> significant terms that appear in this book.

> Additional Information
> ----------------------
>
> Since Java Advanced Imaging continues to evolve and periodically add
> new operators, it is always a good idea to occasionally check the
> JavaSoft JAI web site for the latest information.

> :   `http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/`
>
> The web site contains links to the latest version of JAI, email
> aliases for obtaining help from the community of JAI developers, and a
> tutorial that includes examples of the use of many JAI operators.
