# ImageN

The Eclipse ImageN project provides an extensible, on-demand image processing library with no artificial
restrictions on raster size or number of bands.

ImageN provides:

* Modern Java API using literate programming style
* Pure Java implementation
* Clear image processing operations, allowing installations to use native libs to accelerate processing if available
* On demand processing of large raster content staging tiles in memory for parallel processing
* No artificial limitation on raster size or number of bands to support multi-spectral imagery

Welcome, this is a new project creating:

* New modern Java API
* Pure Java implementation
* Ability to stage larger rasters as tiles in memory and process tiles in parallel
* Clear image processing operations, allowing installations to use native libs to accelerate processing if available
