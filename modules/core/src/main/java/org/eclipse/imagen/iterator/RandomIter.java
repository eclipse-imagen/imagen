/**
 * An iterator that allows random read-only access to any sample
 * within its bounding rectangle.  This flexibility will generally
 * exact a corresponding price in speed and setup overhead.
 *
 * <p> The iterator is initialized with a particular rectangle as its
 * bounds, which it is illegal to exceed.  This initialization takes
 * place in a factory method and is not a part of the iterator
 * interface itself.
 *
 * <p> The getSample(), getSampleFloat(), and getSampleDouble()
 * methods are provided to allow read-only access to the source data.
 * The getPixel() methods allow retrieval of all bands simultaneously.
 *
 * <p> An instance of RandomIter may be obtained by means of the
 * RandomIterFactory.create() method, which returns an opaque
 * object implementing this interface.
