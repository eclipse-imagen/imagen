/**
 * An iterator for traversing a read/write image in top-to-bottom,
 * left-to-right order.  This will generally be the fastest style of
 * iterator, since it does not need to perform bounds checks against
 * the top or left edges of tiles.
 *
 * <p> The iterator is initialized with a particular rectangle as its
 * bounds, which it is illegal to exceed.  This initialization takes
 * place in a factory method and is not a part of the iterator
 * interface itself.  Once initialized, the iterator may be reset to
 * its initial state by means of the startLine(), startPixels(), and
 * startBands() methods.  Its position may be advanced using the
 * nextLine(), jumpLines(), nextPixel(), jumpPixels(), and nextBand()
 * methods.
 *
 * <p> The iterator's position may be tested against the bounding
 * rectangle by means of the finishedLines(), finishedPixels(),
 * and finishedBands() methods, as well as the hybrid methods
 * nextLineDone(), nextPixelDone(), and nextBandDone().
 *
 * <p> The getSample(), getSampleFloat(), and getSampleDouble()
 * methods are provided to allow read-only access to the source data.
 * The various source bands may also be accessed in random fashion
 * using the variants that accept a band index.  The getPixel() methods
 * allow retrieval of all bands simultaneously.
 *
 * <p> WritableRookIter adds the ability to alter the source pixel
 * values using the various setSample() and setPixel() methods.
 *
 * <p> An instance of WritableRectIter may be obtained by means
 * of the RectIterFactory.createWritable() method, which returns
 * an opaque object implementing this interface.
 *
