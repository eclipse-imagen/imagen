/**
 * A node in a directed graph of operations.  Each node maintains
 * three pieces of information, in addition to an arbitrary
 * <code>Object</code> containing user data associated with the node,
 * in order to allow topological sorting to be performed in linear time.
 *
 * <p> First, the in-degree (number of other nodes pointing to this
 * node) is stored as an int.  Nodes with in-degree equal to 0 are
 * "free" and may appear first in a topological sort.
 *
 * <p> Second, a reference called <code>zeroLink</code> to another 
 * <code>PartialOrderNode</code> is kept in order to allow construction 
 * of a linked list of nodes with zero in-degree.
 *
 * <p> Third, a <code>Vector</code> of neighboring nodes is maintained 
 * (in no particular order). These are the nodes which are pointed to
 * by the current node.
 *
 * <p> This class is used by the implementation of the 
 * <code>OperationRegistry</code> class and is not intended to be part
 * of the API.
