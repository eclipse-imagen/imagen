/**
 * This interface provides a description of a specific remote imaging
 * protocol. Information regarding the remote imaging protocol such as
 * its name, the list of operations supported on a particular server, 
 * the capabilities of a server implementing this protocol, human readable
 * documentation detailing how the <code>String</code> identifying the
 * server is structured should all be provided through this interface.
 * Each remote imaging protocol registered with the
 * <code>OperationRegistry</code> must have a <code>RemoteDescriptor</code>.
 *
 * <p> Any implementation of the <code>getName</code> method of
 * <code>RegistryElementDescriptor</code> is expected to return the name
 * of the remote imaging protocol. This is the name under which this
 * <code>RemoteDescriptor</code> will be registered in the 
 * <code>OperationRegistry</code>.
 *
 * <p>There are two <code>RegistryMode</code>s associated with remote imaging.
 * The first is "remoteRendered" which signifies that the remote imaging
 * operations lie in the rendered mode, the other is "remoteRenderable"
 * which signifies that the remote imaging operations lie in the renderable
 * domain and deal with renderable operations.
 *
 * <p> The <code>getServerCapabilities()</code> method returns the
 * capabilities of the specified server. This information may already
 * be known by virtue of being specified in the imaging protocol, or may
 * have to be determined from the server, in which case, the implementation
 * must communicate with the server to get this information. To get the
 * capabilities of the client, the <code>getClientCapabilities()</code> 
 * method, which exists on <code>RemoteRIF</code> can be used. The reason 
 * for the <code>getClientCapabilities</code> method being defined on the 
 * <code>RemoteRIF</code> instead of on the <code>RemoteDescriptor</code>
 * is that the descriptor does not have any way to reference the client.
 * Thus there is no way for the descriptor to report the client
 * capabilities. On the other hand, the <code>RemoteRIF</code> is the
 * factory that creates the client, and therefore can be expected to either
 * know or determine the capabilities of the client.
