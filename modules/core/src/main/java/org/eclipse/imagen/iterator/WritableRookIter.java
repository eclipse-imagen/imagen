package org.eclipse.imagen.iterator;

/**
 * An iterator for traversing a read/write image using arbitrary
 * up-down and left-right moves.  This will generally be somewhat
 * slower than a corresponding instance of RectIter, since it must
 * perform bounds checks against the top and left edges of tiles in
 * addition to their botton and right edges.
 *
 * <p> The iterator is initialized with a particular rectangle as its
 * bounds, which it is illegal to exceed.  This initialization takes
 * place in a factory method and is not a part of the iterator
 * interface itself.  Once initialized, the iterator may be reset to
 * its initial state by means of the startLine(), startPixels(), and
 * startBands() methods.  As with RectIter, its position may be
 * advanced using the nextLine(), jumpLines(), nextPixel(),
 * jumpPixels(), and nextBand() methods.
 *
 * <p> In addition, prevLine(), prevPixel(), and prevBand() methods
 * exist to move in the upwards and leftwards directions and to access
 * smaller band indices.  The iterator may be set to the far edges of
 * the bounding rectangle by means of the endLines(), endPixels(), and
 * endBands() methods.
 *
 * <p> The iterator's position may be tested against the bounding
 * rectangle by means of the finishedLines(), finishedPixels(), and
 * finishedBands() methods, as well as the hybrid methods
 * nextLineDone(), prevLineDone(), nextPixelDone(), prevPixelDone(),
 * nextBandDone(), and prevBandDone().
 *
 * <p> The getSample(), getSampleFloat(), and getSampleDouble()
 * methods are provided to allow read-only access to the source data.
 * The various source bands may also be accessed in random fashion
 * using the variants that accept a band index.  The getPixel() methods
 * allow retrieval of all bands simultaneously.
 *
 * <p> WritableRookIter adds the ability to alter the source pixel
 * values using the various setSample() and setPixel() methods.  These
 * methods are inherited from the WritableRectIter interface
 * unchanged.
 *
 * <p> An instance of WritableRookIter may be obtained by means
 * of the RookIterFactory.createWritable() method, which returns
 * an opaque object implementing this interface.
 *
 * <p> Note that a WritableRookIter inherits multiply from RookIter
 * and WritableRectIter, and so may be passed into code expecting either
 * interface.  WritableRookIter in fact adds no methods not found in
 * one of its parent interfaces.
