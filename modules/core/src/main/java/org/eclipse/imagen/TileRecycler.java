/**
 * An interface to a mechanism which is capable of recycling tiles.
 * In general the term <i>recycle</i> in this context is taken to
 * mean re-using memory allocated to the tile.  This would usually
 * be accomplished by reclaiming the data bank (array) associated
 * with the <code>DataBuffer</code> of the tile <code>Raster</code>.
 * It would also be possible by simple translation of a
 * <code>WritableRaster</code> provided the <code>SampleModel</code>
 * was compatible with the tile required by its eventual user.
 *
 * <p><i>Tile recycling should be used with caution.  In particular,
 * the calling code must be certain that any tile submitted for
 * recycling not be used elsewhere.  If one or more references to
 * tiles submitted to a recycler are held by the calling code then
 * undefined and unexpected behavior may be observed.  A similar
 * caution applies to the tile's <code>DataBuffer</code> and the
 * data bank array contained therein.</i></p>
