/**
 * Jiffle is a scripting language for creating and analysing raster images. The main intention of Jiffle is to free you
 * from having to write lots of Java and JAI boiler-plate code.
 *
 * <p>Jiffle scripts are compiled to bytecode. The compiler first translates the script into Java source which is then
 * passed to an embedded Janino compiler to produce executable bytecode in memory. The resulting run-time object can
 * then be used by client code as a normal compiled java class.
 *
 * <p>For an introduction to Jiffle see the User Guide at:
 * http://jaitools.org/docs/jiffle/latest/userguide/html/index.html
